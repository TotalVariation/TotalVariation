:wave: Hi, I'm Xin Cai (pronounced Sheen Tsai), a PhD student at Artificial Intelligence Research Centre ([AIRC](https://www.ulster.ac.uk/research/topic/computer-science/artificial-intelligence)) at Ulster University, Belfast, UK, with a focus on large-scale crop type mapping from Satellite Image Time Series (SITS), and a keen interest in Computer Vision, Generative AI, and Multimodal Learning. I am committed to bridging the gap between academic research and real-world applications. I firmly believe in the democratization of cutting-edge technologies and open source as the key to creating a more equitable and inclusive society. It would be my greatest pleasure to see my work benefits you in any way.

:smiley: Thank you for reading my profile.
