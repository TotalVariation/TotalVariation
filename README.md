:wave: Hi, I'm Xin Cai, and I am keenly interested in computer vision, generative modelling, and multimodal large language models. I am committed to bridging the gap between academic research and practical applications that make a real-world impact. I firmly believe in democratising cutting-edge technologies and open source as the key to creating a more diverse and inclusive society. It would be my greatest pleasure to see my work benefit you in any way. Please find more information on my [Personal Website](https://totalvariation.github.io/)
