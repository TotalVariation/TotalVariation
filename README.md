:wave: Hi, I'm Xin Cai (pronounced Sheen Tsai), my previous PhD program at AIRC, Ulster University focused on large-scale crop type mapping from Satellite Image Time Series (SITS). Besides, I have a keen interest in Computer Vision, Generative AI, and Multimodal Learning. I am committed to bridging the gap between academic research and practical applications that make a real-world impact. I firmly believe in the democratization of cutting-edge technologies and open source as the key to creating a more equitable and inclusive society. It would be my greatest pleasure to see my work benefit you in any way. [Personal Website](https://totalvariation.github.io/)
